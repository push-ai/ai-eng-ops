## 💡 Use Cases

### AI-Powered Code Reviews
Your team submits a pull request. The AI automatically reviews code against your team's standards, checks for security vulnerabilities, suggests improvements, and ensures consistency with existing patterns—turning every PR into a learning opportunity.

### Automated Test Generation
When you write new features, the AI generates comprehensive test suites including unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases based on your team's testing standards and coverage requirements. Connect to your test frameworks and CI/CD systems for automated test execution and coverage tracking.

### Intelligent Incident Response
When production issues occur, the AI accesses your runbooks, recent changes, and monitoring data from your engineering tools. It generates incident reports, suggests remediation steps, and documents post-mortems following your team's established processes.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Every significant technical decision gets automatically documented. The AI helps draft ADRs by pulling context from code, discussions, and existing decisions, ensuring nothing gets lost as teams scale.

### Documentation That Stays Current
Technical documentation that actually reflects reality. The AI analyzes code changes and automatically updates relevant documentation, API specs, and onboarding guides—no more stale docs.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### The Foundation: Structured Engineering Context

This handbook leverages a powerful approach: **structured markdown files + standardized engineering processes**. Here's why this combination is transformative for engineering teams:

### 1. **Layered Engineering Context Architecture**
Your engineering context lives in multiple layers:
- **Static Context**: Coding standards, architecture patterns, tech stack guidelines (markdown files)
- **Dynamic Context**: Real-time test results, deployment status, monitoring metrics (via tool integrations)
- **Interactive Tools**: Ability to run tests, deploy code, create tickets, review PRs (via AI tool protocols)

### 2. **Intelligent Context Blending**
When you ask AI to "implement a new API endpoint," the system automatically:
```markdown
# AI's Context Awareness Process:
1. Reads coding-standards.md (style and patterns)
2. Accesses architecture-decisions.md (system design principles)
3. Queries test results from CI/CD (current test coverage)
4. Pulls recent changes from version control (avoiding conflicts)
5. Generates code following team patterns
6. Creates tests matching your suite structure
7. Can submit PR via integration (if configured)
```

### 3. **Version-Controlled Engineering Knowledge**
Unlike traditional documentation, your engineering context is:
- **Version-controlled**: Track changes to standards and patterns over time
- **Collaborative**: Teams can contribute and review updates via PRs
- **Portable**: Works across different AI platforms and tools
- **Transparent**: See exactly what context influenced AI code generation

### 4. **Scalable Context Management**
Your markdown files provide the foundation, while tool integrations enable real-time adaptation and action across your entire engineering stack. The key is maintaining consistent standards regardless of which tools you connect.

## 🔄 Process-Driven AI Engineering Operations

One of the core principles of this handbook is **intentional, multi-step AI execution**. Instead of asking AI to complete complex engineering tasks in a single prompt, we break operations into structured, reviewable steps that ensure quality and maintain human oversight.

### Why Process Matters in AI Engineering

**Single-Step AI Problems:**
- Lacks checkpoints for code quality control
- Difficult to iterate and improve incrementally
- Hard to maintain consistency across team members
- No built-in review mechanisms
- All-or-nothing outcomes increase risk

**Multi-Step AI Benefits:**
- Built-in quality gates and code reviews
- Iterative improvement at each stage  
- Consistent execution across team members
- Clear audit trails and decision points
- Fail-safe mechanisms and rollback points

### Example: Feature Development Process

Instead of "implement user authentication," we use this structured approach:

```markdown
## Multi-Step Feature Development Process

1. **📝 Feature Brief**: Generate brief in `/briefs/` folder with requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **🏗️ Architecture Review**: Analyze existing patterns and design approach
3. **📋 Implementation Plan**: Create detailed plan with steps and dependencies
4. **💻 Code Implementation**: Write code iteratively, following team standards
5. **🧪 Test Creation**: Generate comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e)
6. **🔍 Code Review**: Self-review against standards before peer review
7. **👥 Peer Review**: Submit PR with complete context and documentation
8. **✅ CI/CD Validation**: Ensure all checks pass (tests, linting, security scans)
9. **🚀 Deployment**: Deploy to staging for final validation
10. **📊 Monitoring**: Verify metrics and performance post-deployment
```

This process ensures each feature is thoroughly planned, tested, reviewed, and monitored before reaching production.

## 📋 Cursor Rules: Enforcing Engineering Process Discipline

[Cursor Rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) are powerful instructions that control how AI behaves in your development environment. Think of them as **persistent training** for your AI assistant that ensures consistent, process-driven engineering operations.

### What Are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules are custom instructions stored in three levels:

1. **Global Rules** (`Cursor Settings > Rules for AI`): Universal guidelines applied to all projects
2. **Project Rules** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`): Repository-specific rules shared with your team  
3. **Legacy Rules** (`.cursorrules`): Deprecated but still supported project-level rules

These rules ensure your AI assistant follows your established engineering processes and maintains quality standards across all code generation and review interactions.

### How Cursor Rules Work

According to [Cursor's documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules), "Large language models do not retain memory between completions. Rules solve this by providing persistent, reusable context at the prompt level." When a rule is applied, its contents are included at the start of the model context, giving the AI consistent guidance for generating code, interpreting edits, or helping with workflows.

### Example Process-Enforcing Cursor Rules

Here's how we use Cursor Rules to enforce our multi-step engineering process:

```markdown
# Engineering Process Rules

## Multi-Step Execution Required
When implementing any feature or fixing bugs:

1. ALWAYS start by creating a brief or issue analysis in `/briefs/` folder
2. NEVER write code without understanding existing patterns first
3. ALWAYS create tests alongside code (TDD when possible)
4. MUST include review checkpoints before merging
5. REQUIRE passing CI/CD pipeline before deployment

## Code Quality Standards
- Every function must have tests with >80% coverage
- Follow team coding standards (reference coding-standards.md)
- Include error handling and logging
- Write self-documenting code with clear names
- Update documentation for public APIs

## Process Violations
If asked to skip steps:
- Explain why the full process is important
- Offer to complete abbreviated version with clear limitations
- Document any shortcuts taken for future review
```

### Benefits of Rules-Enforced Processes

**Consistency Across Team Members:**
- Junior and senior engineers get same quality guidance
- Processes are followed even when team members are busy or distracted
- New hires quickly learn and follow established workflows

**Quality Assurance:**
- Built-in checkpoints prevent low-quality code
- Testing requirements ensure reliability
- Review steps catch errors before production

**Audit Trail and Compliance:**
- Clear documentation of process steps taken
- Easy to identify where quality issues originated
- Meets compliance requirements for regulated industries

### Setting Up Process-Driven Rules

**Global Engineering Rules** (Apply to all projects):
```markdown
# Engineering Process Discipline Rules

## Multi-Step Approach Required
- Break complex tasks into 3-10 sequential steps
- Create deliverables at each major checkpoint  
- Always include testing and review stages
- Document assumptions and architectural decisions

## Quality Gates
- Write tests before or alongside code
- Review existing patterns before implementing
- Run linters and formatters before committing
- Get code review approval before merging
```

**Project-Specific Process Rules** (`.cursor/rules/code-review.mdc`):
```markdown
---
description: Code review process for all pull requests
alwaysApply: true
---

# Code Review Process

When reviewing code:

1. Brief analysis in `/briefs/[pr-number]-review.md`
2. Security vulnerability check
3. Performance impact assessment
4. Test coverage verification
5. Documentation completeness check
6. Suggest improvements with context
7. Approve with conditions if needed

Never approve code without:
- Passing CI/CD pipeline
- Adequate test coverage
- Security scan approval
- Documentation updates

Reference coding-standards.md and architecture-decisions.md for consistency.
```

This systematic approach ensures that AI engineering operations are deliberate, reviewable, and consistently high-quality—transforming AI from a quick-answer tool into a reliable engineering process engine.

### Prerequisites

- **[Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/)** (latest version) or another AI-powered code editor
- **Git** for version control  
- Basic familiarity with **markdown syntax** and **JSON configuration**
- (Optional) Tool integration setup for connecting to GitHub, CI/CD, monitoring systems

### Quick Start

#### 1. Clone and Set Up Repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/push-ai/ai-eng-ops.git
   cd ai-eng-ops
```

#### 2. Connect Your Engineering Tools (Optional)

This handbook works best when AI can access your engineering tools. Depending on your AI platform, you can connect to:

If you're using Cursor IDE, you can optionally configure tool integrations via MCP. See [Cursor's MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for setup instructions.

**Example Configuration** (`.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Tool integrations are optional. The core value of this handbook comes from well-structured markdown files and Cursor rules that guide AI behavior.

#### 3. Set Up Your Engineering Context

**Create Template Structure**:
```
ai-eng-ops/
├── templates/
│   ├── code-review/
│   ├── testing/
│   ├── deployment/
│   └── documentation/
├── contexts/
│   ├── engineering/
│   ├── infrastructure/
│   ├── security/
│   └── standards/
└── .cursor/
    └── rules/
```

**Define Coding Standards** (`contexts/standards/coding-standards.md`):
```markdown
# Coding Standards

## Style Guide
- Use TypeScript for new projects
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Maximum function length: 50 lines
- Maximum file length: 300 lines

## Naming Conventions
- Variables: camelCase
- Functions: camelCase with verb prefix
- Classes: PascalCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

## Key Patterns
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Implement error boundaries for resilience
```

#### 4. Set Up Process-Driven Rules

Configure Cursor Rules to enforce quality processes:

**Global Rules** (Cursor Settings > Rules for AI):
```markdown
# Engineering Operations Process Rules

## Multi-Step Execution Required
- Break complex tasks into sequential, reviewable steps
- Always create briefs in /briefs/ folder before implementation
- Complete design phase before writing code
- Include review checkpoints and approval gates
- Document all architectural decisions

## Quality Standards
- Minimum 80% test coverage for new code
- All code must pass linting and formatting checks
- Security scans must pass before merging
- Documentation updated for public APIs
```

**Project Rules** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`):
The handbook includes modular process rules organized by engineering domains:
- `general-operations.mdc`: Universal standards (always applied)
- `code-review.mdc`: PR reviews, code quality checks, security audits
- `testing.mdc`: Test generation, coverage requirements, TDD workflows  
- `deployment.mdc`: CI/CD workflows, release processes, rollback procedures
- `incident-response.mdc`: On-call procedures, debugging workflows, post-mortems

This modular approach ensures only relevant rules load based on your current work context, maximizing efficiency while maintaining process discipline.

#### 5. Using AI with Your Engineering Context

Once set up, your AI assistant will automatically use the context files and rules you've defined. You can:

- **Ask for code**: "Implement user authentication endpoint with JWT, following our security standards"
- **Request reviews**: "Review this PR against our coding standards"
- **Generate tests**: "Create test suite for the new API endpoint"
- **Documentation**: "Update API documentation for the changes I just made"

**Example Workflow**:
```markdown
# In Cursor Chat
Implement user authentication endpoint with JWT, 
following our security standards and existing API patterns.

# AI will automatically:
1. Access coding-standards.md (style and patterns)
2. Pull security requirements from contexts/security/
3. Check existing API patterns from codebase
4. Generate code following team standards
5. Create tests matching your suite structure
6. Update API documentation
```

If you've configured tool integrations, the AI can also access real-time data from your engineering tools.

#### 6. Advanced Configuration

**Environment Variables** for secure API management:
```bash
# .env file
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xyz
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-123
CI_API_KEY=secret_xyz
```

**Custom Tool Integration** (Example):
If you want to connect custom engineering tools, you can create integrations using your AI platform's supported protocols. This is optional and depends on your specific tooling needs.

### Testing Your Setup

1. **Verify Context Files**: Ensure your markdown files in `contexts/` are properly formatted
2. **Test Cursor Rules**: Check that `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files are being loaded
3. **Generate Sample Code**: Request AI to create code using your engineering context
4. **Iterate and Refine**: Adjust templates and configurations based on AI output quality

### Next Steps

- Review and customize the templates in `templates/` for your team's needs
- Set up your engineering context files with your actual standards and patterns
- Configure tool integrations if you want real-time data from your engineering stack
- Start using AI workflows for code reviews, test generation, and documentation
