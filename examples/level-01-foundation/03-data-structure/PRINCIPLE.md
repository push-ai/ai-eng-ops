# Data Structure Principle: Invariants Enable Safety

## The Principle

**A well-structured data structure with clear invariants and comprehensive tests enables safe state management and reliable behavior.** Data structures manage state—they need clear contracts, invariant enforcement, and thorough testing to be reliable.

## Why This Matters for AI Engineering

### The Problem with Unstructured Data Structures

When data structures lack structure, AI struggles to:
- ✅ Create classes that work
- ❌ Maintain valid state
- ❌ Understand invariants
- ❌ Test behavior systematically
- ❌ Safely refactor

### How Structure Helps AI

Well-structured data structures enable AI to:
1. **Maintain Invariants**: Clear rules about valid state
2. **Validate State**: Ensure state never becomes invalid
3. **Test Behavior**: Comprehensive tests verify correctness
4. **Understand Contracts**: Clear interface defines expected behavior
5. **Iterate Safely**: Tests catch state corruption

### Characteristics of Well-Structured Data Structures

- **Clear Invariants**: Rules about what makes state valid
- **State Validation**: Methods ensure invariants are maintained
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Class and method docs explain purpose
- **Encapsulation**: Internal state protected from direct access
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Tests verify invariants and behavior

## Copy-Paste Prompt

Use this prompt with your AI coding assistant:

```
Analyze the data structure (class) in the `problem/` directory and create a well-structured version.

Requirements:
1. Define clear invariants:
   - What makes the data structure valid?
   - What are the rules about state?
   - What constraints must always be true?

2. Improve the class with:
   - Clear class docstring explaining purpose and invariants
   - Input validation in all methods
   - Invariant checking (ensure state is always valid)
   - Comprehensive method documentation
   - Proper encapsulation (protect internal state)

3. Handle edge cases:
   - Empty states
   - Duplicate items
   - Invalid inputs
   - Boundary conditions

4. Create comprehensive tests:
   - Test invariants are maintained
   - Test all methods independently
   - Test state transitions
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios
   - Test that invalid state cannot be created

Focus on creating a data structure that maintains its invariants and is safe to use and modify.
```

## Expected Outcomes

After using this prompt, you should see:

1. **Clear Invariants**: Rules about valid state are documented
2. **State Validation**: Methods ensure invariants are maintained
3. **Comprehensive Tests**: Tests verify invariants and behavior
4. **Safe Operations**: Invalid state cannot be created
5. **Well-Documented**: Class and methods are clearly documented

## Key Learning

**Invariants enable safety.** A well-structured data structure:
- Maintains valid state (invariants enforced)
- Validates operations (input checking)
- Documents contracts (clear interface)
- Tests behavior (comprehensive tests)

This foundation ensures the data structure can be safely used and modified.

## Next Steps

1. Use the prompt above with your AI assistant
2. Run the tests to verify invariants are maintained
3. Compare your approach with `solution/` to see example improvements
