# Testing Example - After

This directory contains the improved code and comprehensive tests that demonstrate effective testing principles.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests
pytest tests/test_user_authenticator.py -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/test_user_authenticator.py --cov=main --cov-report=term-missing
```

## What Was Improved

1. **Input Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for all inputs
2. **Error Messages**: Clear, specific error messages
3. **Edge Cases**: Handles boundaries, empty inputs, None values
4. **Complete Workflow**: Added activation method alongside deactivation
5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite covering all scenarios

## Key Learning

The tests revealed gaps in the original implementation:
- Missing input validation
- Unclear error messages  
- Incomplete functionality
- Boundary condition bugs
