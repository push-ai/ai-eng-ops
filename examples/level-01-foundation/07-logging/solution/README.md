# Logging Example - After

This directory contains improved code with comprehensive structured logging.

## Running the Example

```bash
# Run the code to see logging in action
python main.py

# Run tests
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/test_logging.py -v
```

## What Was Added

1. **Entry/Exit Logging**: Log function entry and exit points
2. **Performance Logging**: Track duration of operations
3. **State Change Logging**: Log state changes with before/after values
4. **Error Context**: Include full context in error logs
5. **Correlation IDs**: Trace requests across operations
6. **Appropriate Levels**: Use DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR appropriately

## Key Learning

Structured logging enables:
- Faster root cause identification
- Better performance monitoring
- Traceability of execution flow
- AI-assisted debugging and analysis

See `EXPLANATION.md` for detailed analysis of logging improvements.
