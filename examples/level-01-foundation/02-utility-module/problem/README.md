# Utility Module Example - Problem

This example demonstrates a collection of utility functions that work but lack proper module structure.

## Running the Example

```bash
python main.py
```

## What to Observe

Notice how the functions:
- ✅ Work for basic cases
- ❌ Have no module organization
- ❌ Lack input validation
- ❌ No consistent error handling
- ❌ No tests to verify behavior
- ❌ No documentation of module purpose

## The Problem

Without proper module structure:
- Functions aren't reusable
- No way to verify correctness
- Inconsistent error handling
- Hard to understand module purpose
- Can't safely refactor

## Next Steps

1. Read `../PRINCIPLE.md` to understand the utility module principle
2. Use the provided prompt with your AI assistant
3. Compare improvements with `../solution/` to see proper module structure
