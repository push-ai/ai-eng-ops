# Simple Function Example - Problem

This example demonstrates a simple function that works for basic cases but lacks proper structure for AI iteration.

## Running the Example

```bash
python main.py
```

## What to Observe

Notice how the function:
- ✅ Works for basic cases
- ❌ Has no tests to verify edge cases
- ❌ Lacks input validation
- ❌ No documentation of expected behavior
- ❌ No way to verify correctness

## The Problem

Without proper structure:
- AI can't verify if changes break functionality
- Edge cases are unclear
- Refactoring is risky
- Behavior is undocumented

## Next Steps

1. Read `../PRINCIPLE.md` to understand the simple function principle
2. Use the provided prompt with your AI assistant
3. Compare improvements with `../solution/` to see proper structure
