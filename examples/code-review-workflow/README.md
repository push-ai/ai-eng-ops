# Automated Code Review Workflow

This example demonstrates how to implement an AI-powered code review workflow that automatically reviews pull requests using your team's coding standards and best practices.

## Overview

The automated code review workflow uses tool integrations with GitHub to:
- Analyze pull requests automatically
- Check code against team standards
- Generate review comments
- Suggest improvements with examples
- Track review quality metrics

## Architecture

```
GitHub PR Created
    ↓
Tool Integration (GitHub API)
    ↓
AI Agent (with Handbook Context)
    ↓
Analyze: Code Changes, Standards, Patterns
    ↓
Generate: Review Comments & Suggestions
    ↓
Post: Comments on GitHub PR
```

## Setup

### 1. Configure GitHub Integration

For Cursor IDE users, create `.cursor/mcp.json` to connect to GitHub:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Set Up Context Files

Ensure these context files exist:
- `contexts/standards/coding-standards.md` - Your coding standards
- `contexts/architecture/decisions.md` - Architecture patterns
- `.cursor/rules/code-review.mdc` - Review process rules

### 3. Configure GitHub Webhook (Optional)

Set up a webhook to trigger on PR creation:
- Webhook URL: Your agent endpoint or tool integration URL
- Events: `pull_request.opened`, `pull_request.synchronize`

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: PR Analysis
When a PR is created, the agent:
1. Reads PR description and linked issues
2. Fetches code changes from GitHub (via API or tool integration)
3. Understands change scope and complexity

### Step 2: Standards Check
The agent checks code against:
- Coding standards from `contexts/standards/coding-standards.md`
- Architecture patterns from `contexts/architecture/decisions.md`
- Team conventions and best practices

### Step 3: Quality Analysis
The agent analyzes:
- Code style and formatting
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance implications
- Test coverage
- Documentation completeness

### Step 4: Review Generation
The agent generates:
- Review comments with specific line references
- Code examples for improvements
- Links to relevant documentation
- Priority levels (must-fix vs. nice-to-have)

### Step 5: Comment Posting
Comments are posted to GitHub PR:
- Organized by file and category
- Clear, actionable feedback
- Respectful and constructive tone

## Example Review Comments

### Code Style Issue
```markdown
**Style Issue** (Nice-to-have)
Line 42: Consider extracting this logic into a helper function for better readability.

Current:
```typescript
const result = data.map(item => {
  return {
    ...item,
    processed: item.value * 2 + item.offset
  };
});
```

Suggested:
```typescript
const processItem = (item) => ({
  ...item,
  processed: calculateProcessedValue(item)
});

const result = data.map(processItem);
```

This improves readability and makes the transformation logic testable.
```

### Security Concern
```markdown
**Security Issue** (Must-fix)
Line 78: Potential SQL injection vulnerability. Use parameterized queries.

Current:
```typescript
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
```

Suggested:
```typescript
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1';
const result = await db.query(query, [userId]);
```

```

## Customization

### Review Priorities
Customize what the agent prioritizes in reviews:
- Must-fix: Security issues, breaking changes, test failures
- Should-fix: Code quality, performance, documentation
- Nice-to-have: Style improvements, optimizations

### Review Scope
Configure what files/changes trigger reviews:
- All files: Comprehensive review
- Specific paths: Focus on critical paths
- File types: Code files only, exclude config files

### Comment Style
Customize comment tone and format:
- Formal vs. casual tone
- Include/exclude code examples
- Link to team documentation
- Reference specific standards

## Metrics & Monitoring

Track review effectiveness:
- **Review Coverage**: Percentage of PRs reviewed
- **Issue Detection Rate**: Issues found per PR
- **Resolution Rate**: Issues addressed per PR
- **Time Savings**: Time saved vs. manual reviews

## Benefits

### For Engineers
- **Faster Feedback**: Get immediate code review feedback
- **Consistent Standards**: All code reviewed against same standards
- **Learning Opportunity**: Learn best practices through suggestions
- **Reduced Load**: Less manual review work for reviewers

### For Teams
- **Quality Assurance**: Catch issues before merge
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Standards applied consistently
- **Velocity**: Faster development cycles
- **Scalability**: Handle more PRs without scaling team

## Limitations & Considerations

### Limitations
- May miss nuanced business logic issues
- Cannot fully understand project-specific contexts
- May have false positives for security scans
- Requires human judgment for architectural decisions

### Best Practices
- Use as first-pass review, not replacement for human review
- Configure thresholds to reduce noise
- Regularly update context files with team learnings
- Combine with manual review for critical changes

## Next Steps

1. **Start Small**: Enable for non-critical PRs first
2. **Gather Feedback**: Collect feedback from engineers
3. **Refine Rules**: Update review rules based on feedback
4. **Scale Up**: Expand to all PRs gradually
5. **Measure Impact**: Track metrics and iterate
