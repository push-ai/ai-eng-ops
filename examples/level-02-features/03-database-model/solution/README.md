# Database Model Example - Solution

This directory contains well-structured database models that demonstrate how to design database schemas that AI can reliably understand and modify.

## What Changed

The solution adds comprehensive structure that enables AI to:

1. **Understand model contracts** through explicit field definitions
2. **Generate correct migrations** using defined constraints
3. **Maintain relationships** correctly through explicit definitions
4. **Add indexes** appropriately for performance
5. **Write tests** that verify model behavior

## Running the Models

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create migrations
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=models --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Explicit Field Definitions
- **null/blank constraints**: All fields explicitly defined
- **Validators**: Email validation, age ranges
- **Unique constraints**: Email must be unique
- **Indexes**: Frequently queried fields indexed
- **help_text**: All fields documented

### 2. Clear Relationships
- **related_name**: All ForeignKey fields have related_name
- **on_delete**: Cascade behaviors documented
- **help_text**: Relationships explained

### 3. Model Methods
- **__str__**: User-friendly string representation
- **Properties**: is_adult, post_count, word_count
- **clean()**: Validation before saving
- **save()**: Override to ensure validation

### 4. Model Documentation
- **Docstrings**: All models documented
- **Field help_text**: All fields documented
- **Examples**: Usage examples in docstrings

### 5. Comprehensive Tests
- Model creation tests
- Field validation tests
- Relationship tests
- Constraint tests (unique, etc.)
- Model method tests

## Benefits for AI

With this structure, AI assistants can:

1. Understand the model contract through field definitions
2. Add new fields following the same pattern
3. Modify existing models without breaking contracts
4. Generate correct migrations with constraints
5. Write tests that verify behavior

The key is providing explicit structure at every level: fields, relationships, constraints, indexes, and documentation.
