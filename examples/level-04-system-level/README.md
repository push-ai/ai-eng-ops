> This level contains examples that are still under development and review. The patterns and principles demonstrated may change based on feedback and real-world testing. Use with caution and verify best practices for your specific use case.

## What This Level Focuses On

**Level 04: System-Level** demonstrates how to design and maintain complete systems, including microservices architectures, full-stack applications, legacy code refactoring, and performance optimization. These examples show how to apply AI engineering principles at the system scale, where multiple services, databases, and components must work together reliably.

Each example demonstrates system-level concerns: architecture decisions, service communication, system health, performance, and maintainability. These patterns enable AI to understand and modify entire systems, not just individual components.

## What You'll Learn

By advancing through these system-level examples, you'll understand:

1. **How to design system architectures** that AI can understand and modify
2. **How to coordinate multiple services** in microservices architectures
3. **How to refactor legacy systems** while maintaining functionality
4. **How to optimize system performance** with AI assistance
5. **How to maintain system health** through monitoring and observability

These examples show how to scale AI engineering principles to complete systems, demonstrating patterns that work across entire codebases.

## The Core Principles

Each example demonstrates system-level patterns:

- **01-microservices**: Designing microservices with clear service boundaries and communication patterns
- **02-full-stack**: Building full-stack applications with coordinated frontend and backend
- **03-legacy-refactor**: Refactoring legacy code while maintaining functionality
- **04-performance**: Optimizing system performance with AI assistance

## How to Use These Examples

### Workflow for Each Example

1. **Explore the System**: Review the system architecture and current state
2. **Understand the Patterns**: Read documentation to understand system-level patterns
3. **Practice with AI**: Use prompts from `PRINCIPLE.md` to guide AI through system changes
4. **Review the Solution**: See improved system architecture and implementation
5. **Run and Monitor**: Execute the system and verify behavior

### Prerequisites

## Relationship to Previous Levels

Level 04 applies all previous principles at the system scale:

- **Foundation principles** → Applied across entire systems
- **Feature patterns** → Scaled to complete features
- **Component coordination** → Scaled to service coordination
- **System-level concerns** → Architecture, performance, maintenance

Master Levels 01-03 first, then apply them to Level 04 systems.
