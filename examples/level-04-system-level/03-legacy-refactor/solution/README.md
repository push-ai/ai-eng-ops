# Legacy Refactor Example - Solution

This directory contains refactored legacy code that maintains functionality while adding modern structure.

## What Changed

The solution demonstrates incremental refactoring:

1. **Tests added first** - Verify current behavior
2. **Type hints added** - Make contracts explicit
3. **Validation added** - Enforce constraints
4. **Refactored** - Improved structure while maintaining compatibility

## Running the Code

```bash
# Run the code
python main.py

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Type Hints
- All methods have type hints
- Data structures defined with TypedDict
- Contracts are explicit

### 2. Validation
- Pydantic models for validation
- Input validation on all methods
- Clear error messages

### 3. Tests
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Tests verify current behavior
- Tests enable safe refactoring

### 4. Documentation
- Docstrings on all methods
- Clear parameter descriptions
- Usage examples

## Benefits for AI

With this structure, AI can:
- Understand code through type hints
- Refactor safely with test coverage
- Verify changes don't break functionality
- Improve incrementally
