# Legacy Refactor: Incremental Modernization Enables Safe Refactoring

## What Changed

The solution demonstrates incremental refactoring: adding structure step-by-step while maintaining functionality.

## The Process

### Step 1: Add Tests First
Before changing anything, add tests that verify current behavior. This creates a safety net.

### Step 2: Add Type Hints
Add type hints without changing behavior. This makes contracts explicit.

### Step 3: Add Validation
Add input validation and error handling. This makes edge cases explicit.

### Step 4: Refactor Incrementally
Improve structure one step at a time, running tests after each change.

## Key Takeaway

**Incremental refactoring enables AI to modernize legacy code safely.** Add tests first, then add structure, then refactorâ€”all while maintaining functionality.
