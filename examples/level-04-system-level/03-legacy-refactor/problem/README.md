# Problem: Legacy Code Without Structure

This example demonstrates legacy code that works but lacks the structure needed for AI to reliably understand and modify it.

## The Problem

Legacy code without structure causes:
- No type hints - AI doesn't know data structures
- No tests - AI can't verify changes
- No documentation - AI doesn't understand purpose
- Inconsistent patterns - AI can't apply patterns
- Hidden dependencies - AI breaks things unknowingly

## Run the Code

```bash
python main.py
```

## Issues to Notice

- No type hints
- No validation
- No error handling
- No tests
- No documentation
- Magic numbers and strings
