# Feature Module Example - Solution

This directory contains a well-structured feature module with shared types across frontend and backend.

## What Changed

The solution adds shared type definitions that enable AI to:

1. **Verify type consistency** automatically
2. **Make changes** that propagate correctly
3. **Catch mismatches** before deployment
4. **Coordinate changes** across frontend and backend

## Running the Feature

```bash
# Generate TypeScript types from Python types
cd shared
python generate_types.py

# Run backend
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

# Run frontend (in another terminal)
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Shared Type Definitions
- **shared/types.py**: Single source of truth for types
- **shared/generate_types.py**: Generates TypeScript from Python
- **frontend/src/shared/types.ts**: Generated TypeScript types

### 2. Type Consistency
- Backend uses shared Python types
- Frontend uses generated TypeScript types
- Types always match across stack
- Changes propagate automatically

### 3. Component Coordination
- Frontend and backend import same types
- AI can verify consistency
- Changes require updating one place
- Type safety across entire stack

## Benefits for AI

With shared types, AI assistants can:

1. Understand the complete type contract
2. Make changes that automatically propagate
3. Verify type consistency across components
4. Generate correct code without manual coordination

The key is providing a single source of truth for types across the entire stack.
