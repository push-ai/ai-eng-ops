# Feature Module: Shared Types Enable Cross-Stack Coordination

## What Changed

The solution transforms the feature module from "disconnected types" to "shared types" by creating a single source of truth for types that both frontend and backend use.

## The Transformation

### Before: Separate Type Definitions

Frontend and backend defined types separately:
- Backend: Python dicts/classes
- Frontend: TypeScript interfaces
- No connection between them
- Manual coordination required

**Result**: Type mismatches, inconsistencies, and coordination difficulties.

### After: Shared Type Definitions

Single source of truth for types:
- **shared/types.py**: Python Pydantic models
- **shared/generate_types.py**: Generates TypeScript from Python
- Both sides use generated/imported types
- Automatic consistency

## Key Benefits

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- Types defined once in Python
- TypeScript generated automatically
- No duplicate definitions
- Consistency guaranteed

### 2. Automatic Consistency
- Changes to Python types propagate to TypeScript
- No manual coordination needed
- AI can verify consistency
- Type mismatches caught early

### 3. Better AI Coordination
- AI can see complete type contract
- Changes propagate automatically
- No guessing at type definitions
- Confident cross-stack modifications

## Impact on AI Development

### Before Shared Types:
- AI guesses at type matching
- Manual coordination required
- Type mismatches common
- Changes break contracts

### After Shared Types:
- AI sees single source of truth
- Automatic type generation
- Consistency guaranteed
- Changes propagate correctly

## Key Takeaway

**Shared types enable AI to coordinate frontend and backend reliably.** Without shared types, AI guesses at consistency. With shared types, AI knows.

The most critical elements:
1. **Single source of truth** - Types defined once
2. **Type generation** - Automatic TypeScript from Python
3. **Import/use shared types** - Both sides use same types
4. **Documentation** - Explain type generation process

Everything else follows from this shared foundation.
