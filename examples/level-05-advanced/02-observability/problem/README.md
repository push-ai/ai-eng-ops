# Problem: System Without Observability

This example demonstrates a system that works but provides no visibility into its behavior.

## The Problem

Without observability, AI struggles because:
- No metrics to understand performance
- No logs to trace execution
- No traces to follow requests
- No way to debug issues
- No visibility into system health

## Run the Code

```bash
python main.py
```

## Issues to Notice

- No logging
- No metrics
- No distributed tracing
- No error tracking
- No performance monitoring
