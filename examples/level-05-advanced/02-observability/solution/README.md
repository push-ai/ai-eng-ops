# Observability Example - Solution

This directory contains a system with comprehensive observability: metrics, traces, and structured logs.

## What Changed

The solution adds complete observability that enables AI to:

1. **Understand system behavior** through metrics
2. **Debug issues** using traces and logs
3. **Identify bottlenecks** through performance metrics
4. **Optimize effectively** using observability data

## Running the Code

```bash
python main.py
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Structured Logging
- All operations logged with context
- Correlation IDs for tracing
- Appropriate log levels
- Error logging with stack traces

### 2. Metrics
- Counters for operations
- Timers for performance
- Error tracking
- Success/failure rates

### 3. Distributed Tracing
- Spans for operations
- Trace context propagation
- Span attributes
- Duration tracking

### 4. Error Tracking
- Exception capture
- Error categorization
- Error rate metrics
- Context in errors

## Benefits for AI

With comprehensive observability, AI can:
- See system behavior through metrics
- Debug issues using traces
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize based on actual data
