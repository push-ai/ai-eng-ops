# Observability: Comprehensive Visibility Enables System Understanding

## What Changed

The solution adds comprehensive observability: structured logging, metrics, distributed tracing, and error tracking.

## Key Components

### 1. Structured Logging
- Context in every log
- Correlation IDs
- Error details
- Operation tracking

### 2. Metrics
- Performance metrics
- Count metrics
- Error metrics
- Resource metrics

### 3. Distributed Tracing
- Operation spans
- Trace context
- Duration tracking
- Request tracing

## Key Takeaway

**Comprehensive observability enables AI to understand and optimize systems.** Without observability, AI guesses. With observability, AI knows.
