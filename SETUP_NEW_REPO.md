# Setting Up the New Repository

This guide will help you create the `ai-eng-ops` repository in the `push-ai` GitHub account and push the code.

## Steps to Create and Push the Repository

### 1. Create the Repository on GitHub

**Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface**
1. Go to https://github.com/organizations/push-ai/repositories/new
2. Repository name: `ai-eng-ops`
3. Description: "AI Engineering Operations Handbook - Standards, processes, and templates for AI-driven engineering workflows"
4. Set to **Public**
5. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

**Option B: Using GitHub CLI** (if you have `gh` installed)
```bash
gh repo create push-ai/ai-eng-ops --public --description "AI Engineering Operations Handbook - Standards, processes, and templates for AI-driven engineering workflows"
```

### 2. Update Git Remote

From your local repository directory:

```bash
# Remove the old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add the new remote pointing to push-ai/ai-eng-ops
git remote add origin https://github.com/push-ai/ai-eng-ops.git

# Verify the remote is set correctly
git remote -v
```

### 3. Push the Code

```bash
# Make sure you're on the main branch
git checkout main

# Push to the new repository
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Verify Everything Works

1. Visit https://github.com/push-ai/ai-eng-ops
2. Verify the README displays correctly
3. Check that all files are present
4. Confirm the repository is public

## Notes

- The repository is already configured with:
  - Apache 2.0 License
  - Comprehensive README
  - All context files and templates
  - Documentation

- All references to the repository URL have been updated to `push-ai/ai-eng-ops`

## Next Steps After Setup

1. Add repository topics/tags on GitHub (e.g., `ai`, `engineering`, `cursor`, `mcp`, `devops`)
2. Set up repository description and website URL if applicable
3. Enable GitHub Discussions if you want community features
4. Consider adding GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
