# Engineering Context

This directory contains documentation that defines **development workflows, code review practices, and engineering best practices** for your engineering organization.

## Purpose

Engineering documentation ensures:

- **Consistent workflows** across teams
- **Clear processes** for common tasks
- **Effective collaboration** through documented practices
- **Onboarding** of new team members
- **Guidance** for AI and engineers on development

## What Goes Here

### Development Workflows
- Feature development process
- Bug fix process
- Code review process
- Release process

### Best Practices
- Code review best practices
- Pair programming guidelines
- Documentation standards
- Knowledge sharing practices

### Team Processes
- Sprint planning
- Standup format
- Retrospective format
- Team communication

## How AI Uses Engineering Context

When AI assistants reference engineering documentation, they:

- **Follow workflows** defined in process docs
- **Apply review practices** from code review docs
- **Use patterns** from best practices docs
- **Respect processes** documented in workflows
- **Maintain consistency** with team practices

## Example Files

See `code-review.md` and `development-workflow.md` for examples of engineering documentation.
