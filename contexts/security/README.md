# Security Context

This directory contains documentation that defines **security policies, secure coding practices, and compliance requirements** for your engineering organization.

## Purpose

Security documentation ensures:

- **Secure code** following security best practices
- **Compliance** with security policies and regulations
- **Consistent security** across all systems
- **Clear requirements** for secure development
- **Guidance** for AI and engineers on security

## What Goes Here

### Security Policies
- Authentication and authorization policies
- Data protection policies
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Security incident procedures

### Secure Coding Practices
- Input validation standards
- Authentication patterns
- Authorization patterns
- Encryption requirements

### Security Requirements
- API security requirements
- Database security requirements
- Infrastructure security requirements
- Application security requirements

## How AI Uses Security Context

When AI assistants reference security documentation, they:

- **Implement authentication** according to security policies
- **Apply authorization** following authorization patterns
- **Validate inputs** using security standards
- **Use encryption** as required by policies
- **Follow compliance** requirements strictly

## Example Files
