# Standards Context

This directory contains documentation that defines **coding standards, style guides, and quality metrics** for your engineering team.

## Purpose

Standards documentation ensures:

- **Consistency** across the codebase
- **Quality** through defined metrics and practices
- **Maintainability** through established patterns
- **Onboarding** of new team members and AI assistants
- **Code review** criteria and standards

## What Goes Here

### Code Quality Standards
- Code quality metrics and thresholds
- Test coverage requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation requirements

### Style Guides
- Code formatting standards
- Naming conventions
- File organization patterns
- Comment and documentation styles

### Best Practices
- Common patterns to follow
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Language-specific guidelines
- Framework-specific conventions

## How AI Uses Standards

When AI assistants reference standards documentation, they:

- **Format code** according to style guides
- **Write tests** that meet coverage requirements
- **Follow naming** conventions consistently
- **Apply patterns** from best practices docs
- **Meet quality** metrics automatically

## Example Files

See `code-quality.md` and `style-guide.md` for examples of standards documentation.
