# Architecture Context

This directory contains documentation that defines **system design principles, architectural decisions, and design patterns** for your engineering organization.

## Purpose

Architecture documentation ensures:

- **Consistent design** across systems
- **Clear constraints** and boundaries
- **Informed decisions** based on documented rationale
- **Alignment** with organizational goals
- **Guidance** for AI and engineers on system design

## What Goes Here

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Documented decisions and their rationale
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences and trade-offs
- Context for future decisions

### Design Patterns
- Common patterns used across systems
- When to use each pattern
- Implementation examples
- Pattern trade-offs

### System Constraints
- Technical constraints (languages, frameworks)
- Business constraints (performance, scale)
- Regulatory constraints (compliance, security)
- Operational constraints (infrastructure, costs)

### Integration Patterns
- How services communicate
- API design standards
- Data flow patterns
- Event-driven patterns

## How AI Uses Architecture

When AI assistants reference architecture documentation, they:

- **Follow design patterns** from architecture docs
- **Respect constraints** documented in architecture decisions
- **Apply patterns** consistently across systems
- **Understand trade-offs** when making design decisions
- **Maintain consistency** with established architecture

## Example Files

See `api-design.md` and `service-boundaries.md` for examples of architecture documentation.
