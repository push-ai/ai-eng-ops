## How AI Uses DevOps Context

When AI assistants reference DevOps documentation, they:

- **Follow infrastructure patterns** from docs
- **Apply operational procedures** correctly
- **Use IaC patterns** consistently
- **Respect constraints** documented in procedures
- **Maintain compliance** with operational standards
