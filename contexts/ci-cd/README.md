# CI/CD Context

This directory contains documentation that defines **continuous integration and deployment processes, build workflows, and release procedures** for your engineering organization.

## Purpose

CI/CD documentation ensures:

- **Consistent deployments** across environments
- **Automated quality checks** before deployment
- **Reliable release processes** with rollback capabilities
- **Clear deployment procedures** for all environments
- **Guidance** for AI and engineers on deployment

## What Goes Here

### Build Processes
- Build configurations and steps
- Dependency management
- Artifact creation and storage
- Build optimization

### Testing Pipelines
- Test execution in CI
- Test coverage requirements
- Performance testing
- Security scanning

### Deployment Workflows
- Environment promotion process
- Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, etc.)
- Rollback procedures
- Post-deployment verification

### Release Management
- Versioning strategy
- Release process
- Change management
- Communication procedures

## How AI Uses CI/CD Context

When AI assistants reference CI/CD documentation, they:

- **Follow deployment processes** defined in workflows
- **Use correct build commands** from build documentation
- **Apply versioning** according to release standards
- **Run appropriate tests** before deployment
- **Follow rollback procedures** when needed

## Example Files

See `deployment-workflow.md` and `build-process.md` for examples of CI/CD documentation.
