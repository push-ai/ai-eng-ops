# Monitoring Context

This directory contains documentation that defines **observability requirements, logging standards, alerting rules, and monitoring patterns** for your engineering organization.

## Purpose

Monitoring documentation ensures:

- **Consistent observability** across services
- **Reliable alerting** for production issues
- **Effective debugging** through structured logs
- **Performance visibility** through metrics
- **Guidance** for AI and engineers on observability

## What Goes Here

### Observability Requirements
- Metrics collection standards
- Logging format and structure
- Distributed tracing requirements
- Error tracking standards

### Alerting
- Alert definitions and thresholds
- On-call procedures
- Escalation policies
- Alert routing

### Monitoring Tools
- Tool configuration
- Dashboard standards
- Query patterns
- Integration patterns

## How AI Uses Monitoring Context

When AI assistants reference monitoring documentation, they:

- **Add logging** according to logging standards
- **Implement metrics** following metrics patterns
- **Create alerts** using alert definitions
- **Structure logs** consistently
- **Monitor correctly** using established patterns

## Example Files

See `logging-standards.md` and `alert-definitions.md` for examples of monitoring documentation.
