# Infrastructure Context

This directory contains documentation that defines **cloud infrastructure standards, infrastructure patterns, and infrastructure-as-code conventions** for your engineering organization.

## Purpose

Infrastructure documentation ensures:

- **Consistent infrastructure** across environments
- **Reliable cloud deployments** following best practices
- **Scalable architectures** using proven patterns
- **Clear standards** for infrastructure code
- **Guidance** for AI and engineers on infrastructure

## What Goes Here

### Cloud Patterns
- AWS/Azure/GCP architecture patterns
- Multi-region deployment patterns
- High availability patterns
- Disaster recovery patterns

### Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform/CloudFormation patterns
- Module organization
- State management
- Variable conventions

### Networking
- VPC design patterns
- Security group patterns
- Load balancing patterns
- DNS and routing

## How AI Uses Infrastructure Context

When AI assistants reference infrastructure documentation, they:

- **Follow cloud patterns** from architecture docs
- **Apply IaC patterns** consistently
- **Use networking patterns** correctly
- **Respect constraints** documented in standards
- **Maintain compliance** with infrastructure requirements

## Example Files

See `cloud-patterns.md` and `terraform-standards.md` for examples of infrastructure documentation.
